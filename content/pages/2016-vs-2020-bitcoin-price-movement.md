These are live charts comparing Bitcoin's price movement in
this halving cycle with the previous one.

To accurately compare the periods, we look at percentage
change rather than actual price.

You can hover over the chart to see more details, like the
date, price, and projected price for each cycle.

The charts are interactive.

mode on mobile.
