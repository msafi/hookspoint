    <h1>Bitcoin Loan to Pay the Bills</h1>

    <p>I don't have an income at the moment. I'll have to sell some
bitcoin soon to pay the bills. But with the way bitcoin
keeps pumping, I know I'll regret selling, like this good
fella...</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Regretting every sat I had to sell to pay bills the last 2 years. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a></p>&mdash; Bitcoin Comics (@Bitcoin_Comics) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bitcoin_Comics/status/1319177815690891265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2020</a></blockquote>
<p>So, I'm looking to get a loan instead. Basically, I want to
put off selling any bitcoin as long as possible. For me, the
best way to do that is to take out a loan with a 1-year (or
longer) term. And hope that my coins will continue to
appreciate during that time.</p>
<h2 id="does-this-make-financial-sense">Does this make financial sense <a class="direct-link" href="#does-this-make-financial-sense">#</a></h2>
<p>It all depends on what bitcoin does. If it goes up enough to
make up for the cost of the loan, then yes. If it doesn't,
then no.</p>
<p>Let's say your monthly bills are
$8,000/month. To cover your bills, you'd like to get a loan for $100,000
with a 2-year term and 13% interest. The monthly payment for
such a loan would be around $4,800
(<a href="https://www.amortization-calc.com/loan-calculator/">checkout this calculator</a>)</p>
<p>Now your monthly bills with the loan repayments would climb
up to $12,500/month. At that rate, you'll take about only 8
months to use up the entire loan. Then you'll have 16 more
months remaining on the loan.</p>
<h2 id="worst-case-scenario">Worst case scenario <a class="direct-link" href="#worst-case-scenario">#</a></h2>
<p>Between July 2018 and February 2019, Bitcoin's price
depreciated 50%. Let's assume you took out the loan in July
of 2018, and that your bitcoin stash was worth $150,000 in
the beginning. This is how that would work out...</p>

<p>This is how it works out over the months</p>

<p>Let's say bitcoin goes up 15% during 1-year term, 10%
interest, $100,000 loan. So...</p>

<p>Let's compare the two scenarios. Selling bitcoin to pay the
bills versus taking out a loan.</p>
<p>This will only make financial sense if bitcoin appreciates
more than the cost of the loan. Say, I take out a loan for
$100,000 which ends up costing me
$20,000 in 12-months, so I ended up paying back $120,000.
That means the loan cost me 20%</p>
