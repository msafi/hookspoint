I don't have an income at the moment. I'll have to sell some
bitcoin soon to pay the bills. But with the way bitcoin
keeps pumping, I know I'll regret selling, like this good
fella...

So, I'm looking to get a loan instead. Basically, I want to
put off selling any bitcoin as long as possible. For me, the
best way to do that is to take out a loan with a 1-year (or
longer) term. And hope that my coins will continue to
appreciate during that time.

## Does this make financial sense

It all depends on what bitcoin does. If it goes up enough to
make up for the cost of the loan, then yes. If it doesn't,
then no.

Let's say your monthly bills are
$8,000/month. To cover your bills, you'd like to get a loan for $100,000
with a 2-year term and 13% interest. The monthly payment for
such a loan would be around \$4,800
([checkout this calculator](https://www.amortization-calc.com/loan-calculator/))

Now your monthly bills with the loan repayments would climb
up to \$12,500/month. At that rate, you'll take about only 8
months to use up the entire loan. Then you'll have 16 more
months remaining on the loan.

## Worst case scenario

Between July 2018 and February 2019, Bitcoin's price
depreciated 50%. Let's assume you took out the loan in July
of 2018, and that your bitcoin stash was worth \$150,000 in
the beginning. This is how that would work out...

This is how it works out over the months

| Month     | Cash balance | Left over after bills |
| --------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| 1st       | \$100,000    |
| Nov, 2020 | \$1,035      | \$3,714               |
| Dec, 2020 | \$996        | \$3,754               |
| Jan, 2021 | \$955        | \$3,794               |
| Feb, 2021 | \$914        | \$3,835               |
| Mar, 2021 | \$873        | \$3,876               |
| Apr, 2021 | \$832        | \$3,918               |
| May, 2021 | \$789        | \$3,960               |
| Jun, 2021 | \$747        | \$4,003               |
| Jul, 2021 | \$704        | \$4,046               |
| Aug, 2021 | \$660        | \$4,089               |
| Sep, 2021 | \$616        | \$4,133               |
| Oct, 2021 | \$572        | \$4,178               |
| Nov, 2021 | \$527        | \$4,222               |
| Dec, 2021 | \$482        | \$4,268               |
| Jan, 2022 | \$436        | \$4,314               |
| Feb, 2022 | \$389        | \$4,360               |
| Mar, 2022 | \$343        | \$4,407               |
| Apr, 2022 | \$295        | \$4,454               |
| May, 2022 | \$247        | \$4,502               |
| Jun, 2022 | \$199        | \$4,551               |
| Jul, 2022 | \$150        | \$4,600               |
| Aug, 2022 | \$100        | \$4,649               |
| Sep, 2022 | \$51         | \$4,699               |

Let's say bitcoin goes up 15% during 1-year term, 10%
interest, \$100,000 loan. So...

|                                | With a loan | Without a loan |
| :----------------------------: | :---------: | :------------: |
| Bitcoins sold in the beginning |      0      |       10       |
|               1                |      2      |       3        |

Let's compare the two scenarios. Selling bitcoin to pay the
bills versus taking out a loan.

This will only make financial sense if bitcoin appreciates
more than the cost of the loan. Say, I take out a loan for
\$100,000 which ends up costing me
$20,000 in 12-months, so I ended up paying back $120,000.
That means the loan cost me 20%
